    The ACTS Series was founded by past American champions of sport taekwondo, hence the name American 
    Champions Taekwondo Series. The founders&#39; goal is to provide an opportunity for athletes to hone their 
    skills through elite competition and provide a training ground for Olympic hopefuls. 
    That goal is achieved by promoting events that are highly organized, impartial and 
    refereed by certified professionals.<br /><br />
    The ACTS directors and tournament committee maintain a very high standard. It is 
    a standard that all potential directors 
    must maintain annually to qualify . The ACTS series is currnetly comprised of three core championships. 
    They are the Kansas City Classic 
    Taekwondo Championships hosted by Oren and Terry Gautreaux, the Tournament of Champions hosted by Eui Lee, 
     the Northeast Iowa Taekwondo Championships hosted by Russ O’Connell, and the UTTC Championship hosted by Serapio Medina. <br /><br />
    The ACTS Series awards overall champions in specific divisions at the Tournament of Champions. Athletes must 
    participate in all three championships and place first through third. They are awarded points, 3 points 
    for first, two points for second and one point for third place. The following are the award divisions:<br />
