      <h4>Competitor Spotlight: <span class="yellowtext">Sam Parkinson</span></h4>
      <h5>I am a second Dan Black Belt and I have been in Tae Kwon Do for eleven years. When I was 14 I placed 2nd place at the AAU national championships and qualified for the AAU team trials and went on to earn a spot on the 2004/2005 national team. That year I went to Germany and represented the United States at the German Open. Since then I have qualified for the AAU national team trials every year. Last year I also placed 2nd at the USAT National championships. I continue my training in Tae Kwon Do daily and expect to achieve many more honors in the sport in the years to come. Apart from Tae Kwon Do, I am also very passionate about music and I play shows regularly. I have been blessed with the ability to play music and to have the opportunities I have had in Tae Kwon Do, and I try to thank God daily for that. <br />
